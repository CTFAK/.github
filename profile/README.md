# Who are we?
CTFAK (Standing for **C**lick**T**eam **F**usion **A**rmy **K**nife) is a team focused on making programs centered around things related to Clickteam Fusion such as recreations, reverse engineering, and ease of use.

The team was started by [Kostya](https://github.com/1987kostya1) who originally planned on just making a program called CTFAK that could partially decompile Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location. It has now grown into a team of developers who have all contributed either a little, or a lot to the development of tools for the community.
